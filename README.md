# Customer Segmentation and Dimensionality Reduction: A Study in Unsupervised Learning

##  Project Overview
This project explores two fundamental unsupervised learning techniques:
1. **K-Means Clustering:** Segmenting mall customers based on income and spending patterns to identify target demographics.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reducing a 13-dimensional Wine dataset into 2D and 3D visualizations while maintaining maximum variance.

##  Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-Learn (KMeans, PCA, StandardScaler)
* Pandas & Numpy
* Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Key Results
* **Clustering:** Identified 5 distinct customer groups, including "High-Income/High-Spending" targets.
* **Dimensionality Reduction:** Captured ~66.5% of dataset variance using only the first 3 principal components, allowing for clear visual separation of wine classes.

##  How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
